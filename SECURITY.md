# Security policy

FrameArk processes untrusted network traffic and media. Please report vulnerabilities privately and do not open a public issue containing exploit details, credentials, private packet captures, or user media.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting or a private draft Security Advisory in the `kairowan/FrameArk` repository. Include, when safe:

- affected commit, component, protocol, and platform;
- prerequisites and realistic impact;
- minimal reproduction steps or a sanitized fixture;
- whether secrets, identity, remote input, file access, or memory safety are involved;
- any suggested mitigation.

If private vulnerability reporting is unavailable, open a public issue containing only a request for a private contact channel—do not include vulnerability details.

The project aims to acknowledge complete reports within 72 hours and provide an initial triage within 14 days. These are targets rather than a service-level guarantee for a volunteer project.

## Supported versions

FrameArk is currently pre-alpha and has no supported release line. Security fixes will target the active development branch until the first published release. A supported-version table will be added before 1.0.

## Security scope

Relevant reports include:

- unauthenticated or authorization-bypassing sessions;
- pairing, trust, replay, downgrade, or identity failures;
- parser crashes or unbounded CPU, memory, storage, queue, or recursion use;
- unsafe media URL fetching or management API access;
- sensitive logs, diagnostic bundles, packet captures, keys, or tokens;
- remote input, clipboard, file-transfer, or FFI memory-safety defects;
- build, release, dependency, or artifact supply-chain compromise.

The absence of FairPlay, Widevine, HDCP, certified Cast behavior, or universal Miracast support is not a security vulnerability. FrameArk does not accept requests to bypass DRM or device certification.

The current FANP transport is experimental. It uses QUIC/TLS with an
ephemeral self-signed certificate pinned for the caller's session and a
process-local six-digit pairing code. It does not create persistent device
trust, protect a remembered identity, or expose an internet relay. Do not log,
persist, or reuse pairing codes; report any certificate-verification,
downgrade, replay, or code-disclosure issue privately.

Capability offers are exchanged only after the pinned TLS handshake. The
current schema requires an exact version match and rejects unknown or duplicate
entries before allocation; it does not silently downgrade or authorize media,
remote input, file transfer, or internet relay.

Authenticated control streams enforce one bounded frame per stream and a total
operation deadline. Cancellation closes the connection rather than reusing
partially read state; pairing codes have redacted debug formatting.

## Disclosure and fixes

Maintainers will validate the report, determine affected versions, coordinate a fix and regression test, and agree on disclosure timing with the reporter when practical. Security releases should include an advisory, upgrade guidance, affected-version range, checksums, and credit unless anonymity is requested.

Sanitized regression fixtures may be retained after disclosure. Raw secrets, personal media, and identifying packet captures must not enter the repository.
